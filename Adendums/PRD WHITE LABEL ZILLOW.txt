PRD – WHITE-LABEL ZILLOW-STYLE PROPERTY SEARCH PLATFORM (MVP)

1. GOAL
Build a Zillow-style property search experience for a single tenant (Brandon Wilcox Home Group at 616 Realty) using live MLS/IDX data. This MVP will serve as:
- A fully usable agent-facing tool
- A foundation that can later expand into a white-label SaaS product

2. MVP SCOPE

2.1 Tenant & MLS
- Single tenant (Brandon Wilcox Home Group)
- One MLS/IDX data source for MVP (SimplyRETS recommended for fastest integration)

2.2 Web Application (Next.js)
Core features:
- Map + list search experience (Zillow-style)
- Smooth pan/zoom → fetch new listings in real time
- Filter bar (price, beds, baths, property type)
- Listing cards with images, badges, and summary info
- Listing detail page:
  - Photos
  - Price, beds, baths, sqft, status
  - Full description
  - Required MLS/IDX compliance attribution
  - “Contact Agent” lead form

2.3 Backend (Node/TypeScript BFF)
- A small API layer between the web app and MLS/IDX API
- Endpoints:
  - GET /api/listings (bounds + filters)
  - GET /api/listing/:id (single listing details)
- Normalizes MLS data into a consistent internal structure
- Handles authentication to IDX/MLS provider

2.4 Lead Form
- Sends an email or logs the lead
- Simple, minimal friction
- No login required

3. OUT OF SCOPE (FOR MVP)
- User accounts / saved searches
- Push notifications
- Multi-tenant branding
- Mobile app (Flutter) – starts after web is stable
- CRM dashboard
- Mortgage calculator
- Saved favorites

4. FUTURE PHASES (NOT MVP)
- Flutter mobile app (mirrors web experience)
- Multi-tenant architecture (white-label SaaS)
- Saved searches and accounts
- Notification system
- Admin/CRM tools
- AI search (“Show me homes near downtown with modern kitchens”)
- Multi-MLS federation

5. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Bold minimalism
- Speed-first UX (skeleton loaders, instant map updates)
- Clear trust signals (“Verified MLS Data”)
- Mobile-first layout with map/list toggle
- High clarity hierarchy and readable typography

6. DATA MODEL (MVP VERSION)
Listing {
  id: string
  address: string
  lat: number
  lng: number
  price: number
  beds: number
  baths: number
  sqft: number
  images: string[]
  status: string
  description: string
  brokerageName: string
}

7. PROJECT STRUCTURE (MONOREPO)
white-label-search/
  web/        (Next.js 14)
  backend/    (Node + TS Express API)
  mobile/     (Flutter – future)
  docs/       (PRD, research, workflow)

8. DEVELOPMENT FLOW
- All edits occur in VS Code
- AI tools assist but do NOT own files
- GitHub is the source of truth
- Feature branches → dev → main
