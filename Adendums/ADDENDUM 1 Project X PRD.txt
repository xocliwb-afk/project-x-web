ADDENDUM 1: Project X PRD Addendum – CRM & Integration Strategy
Scope Clarification

Project X will not include a built-in CRM.
The platform will focus exclusively on IDX/search, lead capture, AI-assisted search, and consumer-facing real-estate functionality.

CRM functionality (contacts, pipelines, tasks, automations, drip campaigns, SMS/email engines, team workflows) is formally out of scope.

Core Responsibility of Project X

Listing ingestion via provider abstraction

Normalized listing model

Search, filters, AI search, map results

Lead capture events

Lead routing into external CRMs

MLS-compliant display + SEO-friendly rendering

Broker/agent-specific theming and configuration

Public-facing search UX

Reasoning

Most brokerages and agents are already committed to an existing CRM.
Introducing a second CRM creates workflow fragmentation, duplicate tasks, inconsistent follow-ups, and poor adoption.

Integrating with their existing CRM is the correct product direction.
