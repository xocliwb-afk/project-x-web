CONTEXT ADDENDUM – WHITE-LABEL SEARCH PROJECT

Last major update: 2025-12-04

1. CURRENT STATE (HIGH LEVEL)

- Project goal:
  - Build a white-label, Zillow-style real estate search platform (web + mobile) that starts as a single-tenant MVP for Brandon Wilcox Home Group and can later be sold/white-labeled to other agents/brokerages/MLS orgs.

- Implementation status:
  - GitHub repo:
    - NOT CREATED YET
  - Local clone:
    - NOT CREATED YET
  - VS Code environment:
    - Planned: VS Code with Gemini Code Assist + OpenAI/Codex extensions
    - Not yet attached to a real repo

- Web (Next.js app – planned):
  - Tech stack (planned):
    - Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
    - Mapbox (or similar) for interactive map + clustering
  - Core routes (planned):
    - /search: Map + list search UI (Zillow-style)
    - /listing/[id]: Listing detail page with photos, description, and lead form
  - State management (planned):
    - Zustand slices for map, filters, listings, hover/selection state
  - UX principles (planned):
    - Bold minimalism
    - Fast interactions (skeleton loaders, no janky spinners)
    - Mobile-first, with list/map toggle and FAB contact bar

- Backend (Node/TypeScript BFF – planned):
  - Tech stack (planned):
    - Node.js + Express + TypeScript
  - Responsibilities:
    - Provide BFF endpoints for the web app
    - Normalize MLS/IDX data into an internal Listing shape
    - Manage IDX authentication and API calls server-side
  - Planned endpoints:
    - GET /api/health
    - GET /api/listings  (bounds + filters)
    - GET /api/listing/:id

- Mobile (Flutter app – planned, not started):
  - Intention:
    - Mirror the web search experience (map + list + detail + contact) for iOS/Android
  - Status:
    - Deferred until web MVP and backend are up and stable

- Data source (IDX / MLS – planned):
  - MVP approach:
    - Single MLS/IDX provider for initial build (SimplyRETS is the leading candidate)
  - Status:
    - No live integration yet
    - Normalized Listing schema is defined at a high level but not implemented

- Documentation:
  - PRD skeleton:
    - Exists as a text/markdown definition specifying MVP scope, data model, structure
  - AI workflow:
    - Defined rules for:
      - Single repo, single local folder
      - All edits via VS Code
      - GitHub as source of truth
      - AI tools (Gemini, Codex, ChatGPT) acting as advisors, not file owners
  - Research:
    - Combined research file summarizing UX patterns, competitive analysis, and technical ideas


2. RECENT CHANGES / DECISIONS

- 2025-12-04:
  - Locked in that this chat is the MAIN HUB for strategy, architecture, and planning.
  - Decided that implementation work will often use dedicated task-specific chats (e.g., “WEB – Map & List Layout,” “BACKEND – SimplyRETS Integration”) inside the same project, when appropriate.
  - Established that I (ChatGPT) will:
    - Help decide when to create new focused chats.
    - Provide clear instructions and separate, easy copy/paste prompts for Gemini Code Assist and Codex when actions are needed.
    - Default to normal prose unless you’re clearly about to run commands or AI-based edits.
  - Clarified that AI output should be:
    - Explicit about which files are touched.
    - Kept minimal and non-freelance (no unsolicited repo-wide refactors).

- 2025-12-04:
  - Defined:
    - AI Workflow document (rules for Git, VS Code, and AI tools).
    - PRD skeleton for the MVP (single tenant, single MLS, web-only to start).
  - Agreed on monorepo structure:
    - white-label-search/
      - web/
      - backend/
      - mobile/
      - docs/


3. TODO / NEXT TASKS (HIGH PRIORITY)

Short-term (pre-code):
- Create GitHub repo:
  - Name: white-label-search (or equivalent)
  - Empty repo (no auto-added README/.gitignore from GitHub)
- Clone repo locally:
  - Create base folder structure:
    - web/
    - backend/
    - mobile/
    - docs/
  - Add initial docs:
    - PRD skeleton (prd-skeleton.txt or .md)
    - AI workflow (workflow-ai.txt or .md)
    - context-addendum.txt (this file)
    - Combined research file (e.g., research-raw.txt)
- Open the cloned repo in VS Code:
  - Ensure:
    - Gemini Code Assist is installed and enabled
    - OpenAI/Codex extension is installed and enabled
    - Git is working (git status clean after first commit)

Short-term (early coding milestones, once repo is ready):
- Web:
  - Scaffold Next.js app inside /web (with TypeScript and Tailwind)
  - Create placeholder /search and /listing/[id] routes
- Backend:
  - Scaffold Node+Express+TS app inside /backend
  - Implement /api/health as a sanity check
- Integration:
  - Configure web app to call backend (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL)
  - Verify end-to-end: web → backend → JSON response (stubbed listings)

Medium-term:
- Design and implement the normalized Listing type in backend.
- Implement GET /api/listings with fake/mock data.
- Replace mock data with live IDX integration (likely SimplyRETS).
- Implement first-pass Zillow-style UI: map/list layout, cards, basic filters.
- Add compliant MLS/IDX attribution and a functional “Contact Agent” lead form.

4. WORKING AGREEMENT / REMINDERS

- GitHub repo + local clone in VS Code will be the ONLY source of truth for code.
- No multi-folder working copies.
- AI tools (Gemini, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini web) only suggest or edit code that you then commit via Git.
- This context-addendum should be updated whenever:
  - The repo is created.
  - The first Next.js/Express scaffolding is done.
  - A major design or architectural decision changes the plan.
