Addendum D: Multi-Surface & Future Native App Awareness

Goal: Build web first, but keep it easy to support PWA/native wrappers and eventually Android Auto without rewriting everything.

Rules

Web is the primary surface.

Next.js app is the canonical UX.

Everything else (PWA, native shell) wraps it.

Surface-specific logic must be thin.

Core business logic lives in:

providers (ListingProvider, future CRMProvider)

Tour Engine

shared types

Surfaces (web, PWA, native shell) just call into those.

Android Auto integration must use routing links / APIs, not UI hacks.

App generates routes.

Google Maps (or the car) handles navigation.

No auto-specific logic in your backend; it just exposes routes/tours.

No surface may introduce a new “secret data model” that conflicts with shared types. Shared contract rules everything.
