ADDENDUM 2: “No CRM, Integrations Only” Policy
Policy Statement

Project X shall act as a lead generation and search platform, not a CRM.
The system will capture leads and forward them to external CRMs through one of the following mechanisms:

REST API connectors (HubSpot, FollowUpBoss, GoHighLevel, etc.)

Webhooks (Zapier, Make, CRM generic webhooks)

Email notifications as fallback when CRM integration fails

Broker/agent-specific routing rules

Project X does not store ongoing CRM contact data, deal pipelines, task histories, automations, or communication logs.

Lead Data Retention

Project X may store minimal transient lead data for:

auditing

analytics

retry logic

activity tracking

But it will not replace the CRM as system-of-record.

Compliance & Interoperability

By remaining CRM-agnostic, Project X:

avoids duplicating functionality

reduces development overhead

increases adoption rate

provides maximum compatibility with brokerage tech stacks
