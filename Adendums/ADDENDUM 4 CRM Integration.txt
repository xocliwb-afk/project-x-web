ADDENDUM 4: CRM Integration Strategy Document
Objective

Create a flexible, CRM-agnostic integration layer allowing Project X to work with any brokerage regardless of their CRM choice.

Core Principles

Single Lead Endpoint
All lead capture events flow through POST /api/leads.

Configuration-Driven
CRM integration is controlled by per-broker configs:

{
  crmType: "hubspot",
  apiKey: "...",
  endpointUrl: "...",
  pipelineId: "...",
  tags: [...]
}


Multiple CRM Types Supported

HubSpot REST API

GoHighLevel REST API

FollowUpBoss REST API

Generic Webhook for Zapier/Make

Email fallback

Connector Architecture
Each CRM connector implements a unified interface:

sendLead(lead: Lead, config: CRMConfig): Promise<void>


Retry + Logging

If CRM push fails → retry queue

Log event for debugging

If retries fail → send fallback email to agent

No Contact State Management

Project X does not store contact pipelines, tasks, or automation logic

CRM remains the single source-of-truth

Minimal Required Data
Lead payload includes:

name, email, phone, listingId, listingAddress, message, source


Broker/Admin Control Panel (future epic)
Allows broker to set:

CRM type

API key

Pipeline / stage

Lead tags

Notification emails
