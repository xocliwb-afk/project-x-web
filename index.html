<p style="text-align:center;max-width:680px;margin:0 auto 1.4rem;">REALTOR® + Builder. One accountable partner in Grand Rapids and across West Michigan.</p>

<p>The Brandon Wilcox Home Group is led by Brandon Wilcox, a licensed REALTOR® and a licensed builder. We operate on a simple idea: clarity creates confidence, and confidence creates better outcomes. You get straight assessments, real numbers, and a plan aligned to your goal—buying smart, selling for more, or improving after close.</p>

<p>Brandon blends field-tested construction experience with disciplined representation. Known for direct answers, practical scopes, and an ROI mindset, he focuses on protecting budget, reducing risk, and delivering results without drama across Grand Rapids and greater West Michigan.</p>

<p>Renovation is optional. We never push projects. We recommend right-sized work only when it measurably improves your net or reduces risk. If the smartest move is to list as-is or buy move-in ready, we’ll say so.</p>
